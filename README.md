## This is a json parser to present old instagram threads in a pretty and organized way.
We are ultimately planning to have a registered web domain with a flask backend where instagram message .json files can be uploaded and shown, of course, with no data being logged/saved on the server for privacy.

Instagram messages are included in the "messages" directory of the file that must be requested from Facebook. 

The official instructions from Facebook to download your Instagram data: 

1. Click your profile picture in the top right corner, then click **Settings**
1. Click **Privacy and Security**.
1. Scroll down to **Data Download** and click **Request Download**.
1. Enter the email address where you'd like to receive a link to your data and click **Next**.
1. Enter your Instagram account password and click **Request Download**.
You'll soon receive an email titled Your **Instagram Data** with a link to your data. Click **Download Data** and follow the instructions to finish downloading your information.
**Note**: It may take up to 48 hours for us to email you a download link. Some data you have deleted may be stored temporarily for safety and security purposes, but will not appear when you access or download your data.
